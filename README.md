# Rearx
A TUI client for the Searx meta-search engine, written in Rust

# How to use it
Write rearx + "search query" on your terminal.

# Keybinds
Right arrow -> Go to next page\
Left arrow -> Go to previous page\
f -> Go to first page\
q -> Quit

# Installation
An AUR package is on its way, but for now you have to compile the code using cargo build --release

# Platforms
Only Linux is officially supported. Windows support is not planned nor possible because the program depends on the termion crate. It might compile on MacOS, but you are on your own.
